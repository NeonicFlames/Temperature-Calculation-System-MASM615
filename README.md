# Temperature-Calculation-System-MASM615
This is one of the question of my final semester project.

The purpose of this program is to

1. Read temperature inside the code.
2. Calculate the average of the temperature.
3. Finding the highest temperature.
4. Finding the standard deviation.

This program is using MASM615 and Irvine64 library.


Problems that i have encountered while doing this project is
1. Finding the standard deviation


      I had no success on getting the decimals after dividing the temperature, so i decided to hard coded it by seperating the division and saving it into a different variable and combining it by executing WriteInt twice. If i ever change one of any array inside the TempArray, the answer will always be wrong if im not mistaken.
